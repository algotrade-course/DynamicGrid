# Group 5 - Dynamic Grid Strategy
  

## Abstract

The project provides an implementation of the grid strategy that aims to remove the need to identify market trends, and instead relies on utilizing price fluctuations to make trading decisions. We designed our solution specifically for Vietnam's derivative markets where the settlement date T+0, allowing traders to open and close multiple positions in a day. The resulting product can generate a 4.12% holding period return when applied to VN30F1M contract data in 2023.

  

## Introduction

It is often hard for novice traders to correctly identify the market is experiencing a bullish or bearish trend, and take corresponding actions. Mis-identifying trends can lead to decisions that have a negative impact on your net asset value of your portfolio. Grid strategy emerges as a distinctive strategy within the trading realm. It removes the need to recognize momentum patterns, but instead utilizes price fluctuations in the market.

  

Our approach dynamically set a trading range that is a predefined number of intervals (called "levels") above and below the current price, or also called the "pivot" point. Prices below the pivot signifying a long position, and prices above the pitot signifying a short position. The expectation is prices will revert back to a grid level, regardless of the type of positions that are opened.

  

We trained the parameter set of our strategy on the VN30F1M futures index, a derivative instrument linked to the Vietnamese VN30 equity index. The chosen period is within mid-February 2024 and April 2024, because it contains both sideways and trending market movements which may help the trained algorithm to perform better on out-of-sample data or in real trading. After the parameter set has been learned, we apply our algorithm on 2023 market data and generate a 4.12% holding period return during the period.

## Data

The input data is a table that has 2 columns: the datetime index and the prices of only one of the VN30 forward contracts: VN30F1M, VN30F2M, VN30F1Q, or VN30F2Q.

There are 2 options for input data:

1. You can use the sample datasets for VN30F1M contracts during 2022 and 2024 are provided in the `data/sample` folder.

2. Or, you can configure your database to work with our solution. 
- Create `.env` file and enter your data source configuration with the format:

```

DB_HOST=<host or ip>

DB_PORT=<port>

DB_NAME=<database name>

DB_USER=<username>

DB_PASSWORD=<password>

```

- Provide the SQL query to fetch the data in file `data/query.txt`. The returned response must satisfy the above requirements of data table schema. More information on how to write SQL queries can be found [here](https://sqlbolt.com/).
- In `config/config.yaml` set `fetch_data: true` (mandatory) and set `save_fetched_data: true` (optional).
## Implementation

- Requirements: Python 3.10 must be installed. Detailed guide on how to install Python can be found in the official [Python guide](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html).

- Install the necessary dependencies:

```

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate (for Linux distros)

.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat (for Windows)

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

- Test for successful installation and show help:

```

python src/driver.py -h

```

Expected output:

```

usage: driver.py [-h] --mode {backtest,optimize} [--data {in_sample,out_sample}] [--config CONFIG]

Grid Trading Backtest and Optimization

options:

-h, --help show this help message and exit

--mode {backtest,optimize}

Run mode: backtest or optimize

--data {in_sample,out_sample}

Data to use for backtest (only applicable for backtest mode)

--config CONFIG Path to config file

```

- We have provided a `config.yaml` file in `config/config.yaml` to configure and control the in-sample backtesting, optimization, and out-sample backtesting processes of our program. The parts of this `config.yaml` are explained as belows:

```

data:

in_sample_file: "<file path>"

out_sample_file: "<file path>"

fetch_data: {true / false}

save_fetched_data: {true / false}

in_sample:

start_date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"

end_date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"

out_sample:

start_date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"

end_date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"

results:

base_directory: "<file path>"

```

- Strategy parameters: These parameters define the important behaviour of our trading program. These are shared by both in-sample and out-sample backtesting modes.

```

strategy:

# Capital and trade settings

capital: <number>

contract_value: <number>

margin_rate: <number>

fee_per_trade: <number>

# Grid-strategy-specific parameters

grid_size_factor: <number>

minimum_grid_size: <number>

move_pivot: <number>

take_profit_factor: <number>

```

- Optimization parameters: These define the range of possible values for grid-strategy-specific parameters that are used for the optimization process. Our program will find the optimal combination of parameters that produce the best **Sharpe ratio** and output its findings.

```

optimization:

# Number of trials for optimization

# The greater the number of trials is, the longer it takes for the optimization process to complete its job, but the better the result is.

n_trials: <number>

# Parameter search ranges

grid_size_factor_range: [<left bound>, <right bound>]

minimum_grid_size_range: [<left bound>, <right bound>]
